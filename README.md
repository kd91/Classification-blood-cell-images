# Classification-blood-cell-images
Multi-class classification of patient's blood cell images using Deep Learning (DL) Models

The diagnosis of blood-based diseases often involves identifying and characterizing patient blood samples. Automated methods to detect and classify blood cell subtypes have important medical applications.

Classification of blood cell images into either of the following classes/ cell types:
1. Eosinophil
2. Lymphocyte
3. Monocyte
4. Neutrophil

Project file includes:
- Custom deep learning model using keras (accuracy=87%)
- Deep learning model using transfer learning (VGG16) (accuracy=53.8%)
